Physics Engine:
 - while falling, ignore movements, check directly below - done
 - If collision test return true, move the entity away
 - remove the effect of vertical look direction on move speed - done
 - try to replace last tick duration?
 - apply gamespeed and gamestate to movements,etc but in realtime ticks since we don't want physics to get clunky at low game speeds
 - prevent infinite jumps


 Entire Engine:
  - specify integer types, choose fastest ones possible
  - reduce memory consumption by world compartments and entities
  - replace asserts in initializers with dynamic checks (but not in hot paths)

  Executor
   - move periodic task defs to a header?
   - add dispatch/async capability? threadpool?
