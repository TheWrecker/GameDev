- assignable keys for actions/events

- add orbit/third person/top-down camera

- rebuild buffers at most once perframe, using a need_rebuild flag/.... (we are now calling rebuild() eachtime  arbitrarily)

- mechanism to update invalid pointers to scene elements after object construction

- update mechanisms for pointers when they are changed (e.g. camera change resonates to player.camera)

- fix all direction level indicator in file paths and include paths (/ vs \)
